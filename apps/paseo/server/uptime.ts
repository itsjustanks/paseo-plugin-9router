 * Uptime and restart history for the local 9router process.
 *
 * 9router's own /api/health returns only `{ok:true}` and every richer endpoint
 * (/api/status, /api/stats, /api/uptime) is behind the dashboard cookie, so a
 * panel that only had the password would still show nothing useful when the
 * router is wedged or the cookie has expired. The OS always knows, so uptime is
 * read from the process table instead: it works unauthenticated, and it keeps
 * working in exactly the states worth reporting.
 *
 * Restart history cannot come from the process table (a restarted process has
 * no memory of its predecessor), so each observed PID/start-time pair is
 * recorded here. That is what makes "last restart" and "restarts today"
 * answerable at a glance -- the question that actually matters after a session
 * drops mid-turn.
